This github project contains a set of very simple and essential example of PDI blueprints.
With blueprint we mean that the concept or best practice described is applicable in many areas.

Topics covered so far:

- auto_create_table : Automatically drop and create tables based on their layout.  Field quoting, casing and so on is handled by PDI. 
                      Execute this example first so that you have all the required tables of the other examples.

- model_driven : These examples show how to externalize metadata w.r.t. PDI using ETL Metadata Injection.  It demoes SDR as well.
